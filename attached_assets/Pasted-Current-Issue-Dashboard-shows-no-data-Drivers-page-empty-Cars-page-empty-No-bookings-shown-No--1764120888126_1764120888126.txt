Current Issue:

Dashboard shows no data

Drivers page empty

Cars page empty

No bookings shown

No customers module

No vendors login

Required Solution:
A. Implement Proper Data Fetching

All pages must fetch data from backend API using proper endpoints.

Drivers list must show all drivers from DB.

Cars list must show all cars from DB.

Dashboard cards must show totals for:

Total Bookings

Completed

Pending

Cancelled

Revenue

Drivers Online

Cars Active

B. Add Demo Data (Seeders)

Add temporary seed demo data:

10 sample drivers

8 cars

12 customers

15 bookings (mix of completed + cancelled + pending)

Later, add a command or button to wipe demo data.

2️⃣ ADD FULL CUSTOMER MODULE (NEW REQUIREMENT)
Customer Fields Required:

Full Name

Phone Number

Email

WhatsApp number (optional but same as phone)

Total rides taken

Lifetime revenue

Preferred car type

3️⃣ OPERATOR ROLE (NEW USER ROLE)

4️⃣ VENDOR LOGIN SYSTEM (NEW MODULE)

Vendor Features:

Vendor API Structure:

/vendor/login

/vendor/stats

5️⃣ WHATSAPP BUSINESS API INTEGRATION (PREP SETUP)

We are NOT connecting right now (until WhatsApp approval).
We are building the system structure so when token is provided later, everything works instantly.

Create a WhatsApp Notification Microservice (recommended design):
A. Structure Needed Now:

Create backend helpers for:

sendWhatsAppToCustomer()

sendWhatsAppToDriver()

sendWhatsAppToAdmin()

B. Keep config placeholders:

WhatsApp API Token

WhatsApp Phone Number ID

WhatsApp Business Account ID

Templates registry

C. Logs

Save logs for each message:

Delivery status

Timestamp

6️⃣ EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS SYSTEM (PREP + IMPLEMENTATION)

{{price}}

Email Logs Table Required:

8️⃣ FIX DASHBOARD — ADD REAL DATA + STATS

🔟 VERY IMPORTANT — FUTURE-PROOF API ARCHITECTURE

Create all communication as separate modules:

notifications.email.js	Email sending templates
models/customer.js	Customer DB model
models/vendor.js	Vendors DB model
models/driver.js	Driver model
models/cars.js	Cars model
models/booking.js	Bookings model
services/fareEngine.js	Fare rules system
services/maps.js	Google Maps distance + autocomplete
services/auth.js	Admin, Operator, Vendor login

✔ Fix all data loading
✔ Add demo seed data
✔ Add customer module
✔ Implement operator role (limited permissions)
