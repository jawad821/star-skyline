OBJECTIVE:
Add a complete Vendor Management Module in the backend and a Vendor Login Panel — without breaking any existing booking, driver, vehicle, or payment system.

⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY RULES (MUST FOLLOW)

❌ Do NOT change existing database schema unless explicitly required

❌ Do NOT break auto-assignment, bookings, or drivers logic

❌ Do NOT remove existing APIs or roles

Create a new Vendors tab in Admin Panel showing:

🔹 Vendor Listing (Grid/Table)

For each vendor show:

Vendor Name

Phone

Email

Status (pending / approved / rejected)

Fleet Summary

Total Vehicles

Vehicle Types Breakdown (e.g. 3 Sedan, 2 SUV)

Total Completed Bookings

Total Earnings (from completed bookings)

Pending Payout Amount

🔹 Vendor Detail / Profile Page (Admin View)
