1️⃣ Fix the Vehicles Table Schema Mismatch

Please open the vehicles table and compare the actual column names against what the seed script expects.

Action:

Update the seed script to match the actual DB schema
or

Update the DB schema to match the seed script structure (whichever is easier)

Goal:
✔ Seed data must run successfully
✔ All demo data (drivers + vehicles + customers + bookings) should load in UI

2️⃣ After Seed Script Works — Populate the Dashboard

Once demo data is inserted:

Dashboard should auto-populate with counts

Customers module UI should show data

Drivers & cars should show data

Bookings table must show the seeded 15 bookings

3️⃣ Add Vendor Login System (Next Priority)

Vendor features needed:

Vendor login

Vendor sees ONLY their drivers, cars & bookings

Vendor cannot see admin settings

Vendor cannot edit fare rules or system configs

You can create a new user role: vendor

And provide:

/vendor/login

Role-based access filtering

4️⃣ Add Email + WhatsApp Notification Structure (Don’t integrate yet)

For now just create the structure, not the live integration.

Create notification helpers:

sendWhatsAppToCustomer()

sendWhatsAppToDriver()

sendWhatsAppToAdmin()

sendEmailToCustomer()

sendEmailToDriver()

sendEmailToAdmin()

Add:

Logging table for notifications

Config placeholders for WhatsApp Business API & Email SMTP

No API keys needed right now.
Just make the functions ready to be plugged in.

5️⃣ Implement Booking Notification Workflow

Whenever a booking is created:

Trigger notifications to:

Customer

Driver

Admin

Use dummy console logs for now:

Example:

WhatsApp Message → [customer number] | Booking #123 Created
Email Sent → [driver email] | New Booking Assigned


Once WhatsApp API goes live, we will switch these logs to real messages.

6️⃣ Operator Role Permissions Review

Operator should NOT have access to:

Fare rules

API keys

System settings

Export data

Vendor management

Please confirm operator role is properly restricted.

7️⃣ Prepare for Customer Profile Enhancements

Customer profile must include:

Past booking history

Total spend

Preferred car type

Last ride date

Notes field

This will later connect to WhatsApp automation + marketing.

8️⃣ Optional — Share Your Vehicles Table Schema

If you want, I can fix the seed script instantly —
just share the actual vehicles table schema (column names + types).
